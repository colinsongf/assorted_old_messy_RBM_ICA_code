### A bit of old RBM / ICA code

This is some old and messy research code that probably isn't of much use to anyone. I'm releasing it because part of it was used to produce a couple plots in the below paper. If you find this paper or code useful, we encourage you to cite the paper.

### Caveat coder

*Note: this is unsupported research code. The very simple results in the paper are probably easier to reproduce simply using the (much simpler and cleaner) snippets of code included throughout the paper.*
